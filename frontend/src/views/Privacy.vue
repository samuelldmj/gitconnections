        # Privacy Policy for GitConnections

        **Last Updated: July 04, 2025**

        At GitConnections, we prioritize your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your data when you sign in
        with
        GitHub.

        ## Data We Collect
        When you sign in with GitHub, we request the following permissions:
        - **Read your followers list**: To identify users who don’t follow you back.
        - **Unfollow on your behalf (optional)**: To allow you to unfollow non-followers with one click.

        We only access the data necessary to provide these features and do not store or share your personal information
        beyond
        the GitHub API scope.

        ## How We Use Your Data
        - **Functionality**: We use your followers list to compute non-followers and enable unfollow actions.
        - **Security**: Data is processed securely via our backend proxy and is not persisted long-term.
        - **No Third-Party Sharing**: We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.

        ## Data Retention
        We do not store your GitHub data after your session ends or upon sign-out. All processing occurs in-memory
        during your
        active use.

        ## Your Rights
        - You can sign out at any time to revoke access.
        - Review GitHub’s [permissions settings](https://github.com/settings/applications) to manage or revoke our app’s
        access.

        ## Contact Us
        For questions, email us at support@gitconnections.com.
